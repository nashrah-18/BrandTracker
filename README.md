# BrandTracker

**Capstone Project (Semester 1)** — *Work in Progress* 

**BrandTracker** is a smart price-tracking and brand-awareness platform.
While this project will evolve into a **full-fledged application** in the next semester, the current version is a **temporary web application** built as part of the Semester 1 capstone.
- Upcoming focus: **Android development** with **AI model integration** (hopefully).
