# BrandTracker (Capstone sem 1):
 Will turn it into an application in next semester, currently learning andriod and ai models integration. But for semester 1, here is a temporary website.
 
# What it does:
- Tracks prices of the products across multiple e-commerce websites.
- Search your favourite product and compare the prices, buy the same product at cheapest price.
# HIGHTLIGHT: It tracks brands.
- If you care about envoirnment, like animal creulty, presrvatives, etc, search your brand (Eg. Garnier, MamaEarth) and our bot will tell you whether the brand is safe or not. 

# Screenshots of the output!
